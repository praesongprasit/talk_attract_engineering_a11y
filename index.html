						<p>Hi, I'm Prae, a Thai woman with shoulder length dark hair. I'm wearing a large pair of dark full-frame glasses and a mint coloured shirt.</p>
						<p>I've been a UX focused front-end web engineer for 9 years.</p>
						<p>But I actually started my career as a designer. Hence my deep appreciation for design craft, especially UX parts of it.</p>
						<p>I love coding up designs in a responsive manner, and improving usability of those designs through code.</p>
						<p>I spent most of my career focusing on how to make UI design and UX pattern scales.</p>
						<p>I've done that while collaborating closely with designers, to ensure that there is reasonable consistency between implementation and designer's vision. I rely heavily on in-house pattern libraries and design systems to do that.</p>
						<p>I owe a lot of my career to the UX designers and researchers I've worked with. That's apparently most of you. </p>
						<p>You have constantly reminded me of who my users are, and their needs. You've helped me understand our user's feedback after features have been released, and collaborate on a way to incorporate that feedback.</p>
						<p>In the last few years, I've gone even deeper into my front-end craft, and have been focusing my efforts on creating and advocating for accessible interfaces. </p>
						<p>As I advocate, I noticed a different level of enthusiasm for accessibility among all roles. Some are really enthusiastic about it, and some, not so much.</p>
						<p>Over and over, I come accross a theme of sentiments...</p>
					</aside>

					<blockquote>
						Engineers are less engaged with accessibility
					</blockquote>
					<p>If true... Why is that?</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Many designers told me that it's hard to get engineers engaged in accessibility.</p>
						<p>Engineers just don't seem interested!</p>
						<p>Some designers even struggle with getting their designs implemented properly in the first place. Let alone getting it implemented in a technically accessible way. </p>
						<p>Everyone's situation is different. Assuming that this statement is actually true... The main question, is why?</p>
						<p>Why aren't engineers more engaged in accessibility work?</p>
						<p>To answer that question, let's take a step back, and treat engineers likeâ€¦ A user.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Engineers as a user</h2>
					<p class="fragment">
						traditional &amp; non-traditional background
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>From my humble understanding of the user centred design practice, you start by empathising with your users. In this case, you'd ask:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Who are the engineers?</li>
							<li>What do they need to do their job?</li>
							<li>What do they want?</li>
							<li>How they currently do things</li>
							<li>How they'd like to do them</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<p>[Next] First, who are the engineers?</p>
						<p>At a high level, my job is to implement the best possible technological solution to a problem.</p>
						<p>Like any user group, engineers come from diverse backgrounds. They could be neurodiverse, disabled, didn't finish high school, was a doctor and switched career, and etc.</p>
						<p>But the aspect that I want to highlight, is that not all engineers had formal education related to programming.</p>
						<p>For programmers with a traditional background, they took a degree that taught them nothing about design, and everything to do with how to break down problems and solve it using technologies.</p>
						<p>A lot of the programming concepts taught in university is very much backend and data focused, so it's usually safe to assume that they're better at that aspect of software development.</p>
						<p>For engineers from non-traditional like myself, my skillset was mostly developed by tasks that my workplace prioritise, and teaches me.</p>
						<p>I happen to work in a place with a lot of UI focused work, and interactions with designers. So I am stronger with that aspect of programming.</p>
						<p>Unless the engineer was taught or worked closely with design and research, they wouldn't understand how to proactively approach these subjects.</p>

					<h3>Responsible for...</h3>
					<p>
						Creating, testing, &amp; maintaining software<span class="fragment"><br>in a <em>usable, secure, privacy focused, responsive, scalable, testable, maintainable, performant, efficient, resilient, safe, accessible,</em> and 100+ manner</span>
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>In most companies, engineers are expected to create, test and maintain software.</p>
						<p>That's pretty reasonable right?</p>
						<p>The trickier thing, is the manner in which they're expected to engineer software</p>
						<hr>
						<p>[Next]</p>
						<p>We have to engineer software, in a usable, secure, privacy focused, responsive, scalable, testable, maintainable, performant, efficient, resilient, safe, accessible, and 100+ manner</p>
						<p>Not a very readable slide is it? It just goes to show what is on engineer's mind when they're writing that 10 lines of code.</p>
						<p>This is why, writing code is a team sport. And why there'll always be more engineers than designers.</p>
						<p>It's not possible for 1 engineer to be able to write code in all the ways we expect our software to be. It takes different types of engineers with different specialities to make up a team of people, who can collectively do all of this.</p>
						<p>Having multiple team members will help remind each other to be accountable for different aspects of software engineering practice.</p>

						<p>In order for us to engineer web application in such ways, many of us will have to learn and use a lot of these tools and concepts</p>
						<p>They may be a front-end focus engineer like myself, a backend person, or a full-stack which covers both side of these learning paths.</p>
						<p>Where does accessibility fits into all this? Well... here [next]</p>
						<p>But as you can see, it's a rather small part of the front-end engineering toolkit and practice.</p>
						<p>If your developer is backend focused, or is a full-stack, they're less likely to even be aware of accessibility. It isn't taught in most courses</p>
						<p>Even if you're a front-end developer, it takes a certain types of clients or products that focus on it so strongly.</p>
						<p>And because there's so many things to learn and keep up-to-date with, we prioritise learning the things our work and our team cares about.</p>
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h3>Want...</h3>
					<p>Priority, process, simple</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Since engineers like myself is responsible for so many things and have to constantly learn to keep up with the technologies, I want 3 things in this particular order: Priority, process, simple</p>
						<p>
							First, I want to <strong>prioritise</strong> things that are more important or pressing.
						</p>
						<p>
							If I don't understand, or am not aware of the context or user problems of a particular solution, I will rely heavily upon what designers and product managers tell me what are important things to work on and why.
						</p>
						<p>
							If assistive technology use isn't a part of the things product functions prioritise, I'm less likely to think about supporting it.
						</p>
						<hr>
						<p>
							Second, I want <strong>processes</strong> to help them manage my load
						</p>
						<p>
							This comes in the form of all sorts of methodologies. Often scrum and its family of ceremonies like standups, backlog refinement etc.
						</p>
						<hr>
						<p>
							Lastly, I want to <strong>simplify</strong> as much as possible
						</p>
						<p>
							Not because I do not want to do the work. Far from it. But breaking down into simplest and smallest units help me ship things out faster, and reduce the amount of in-progress things I need to think about.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unfortunately, this also means that things which are not explicitly mentioned in the requirements or definition of done, can be easily missed.

					<h3>Workflow management</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>So how do engineers run their week? Through ceremonies like scrum and many others.</p>
						<p>I've been told that the majority of the designers at Allianz are embedded in teams.</p>
						<p>That's amazing news, and handy for me, as you're probably already familiar with the ceremonies agile teams have.</p>
						<p>But in case some of you aren't familiar with how engineers manage their work, this is a high level of how the work is managed.</p>

					<h3>Engineers</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Solve problems via code</li>
						<li>Lack experience with UX practice</li>
						<li>Continuous learners</li>
						<li>Cognitive load &amp; time poor</li>
						<li>Want clear priority, process, simplify where possible</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Alright, so I've just spent a large amount of time telling you what itâ€™s like to be an engineer. A recap on the user profile:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Solve problems via code</li>
							<li>Lack experience with UX practice</li>
							<li>Continuous learners</li>

							<li>Want clear priority, process, simplify where possible</li>

						<p>Based on what we now understand about engineers as a target audienceâ€¦ How might we fit accessibility into their lives?</p>
						<p>When you received a lukewarm response to â€˜let's make this accessibleâ€™, what was really happening?</p>
						<p>I have a question to ask all of you...</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>How do you work with engineers?</h2>
					<p>
						Often, not closely enough 
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Accessibility is a way to achive inclusive design. Like all design concepts, it is best taught by practice</p>
						<p>[experience with not being close to audience]</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Include engineers in design</h2>
					<p>
						Show, don't tell
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>How often are you talking about customers research to your engineers?</p>
						<p>How often are they involved in your research and ideation sesions?</p>
						<p>When was the last time they talked to a customer with you?</p>
						<p>Do you talk about accessibility as you walk through your designs?</p>
						<p>Do you annotate your designs with accessible copy and keyboard interaction order?</p>
						<p>Do customer support raise accessible issues and does that issue gets prioritised?</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Lead by example</h2>
					<p>
						Embed accessibility in your practice
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Embed accessibility in your practice.</p>
						<p>We need product people, which includes product owners, managers, researchers, and designers, to be interested in accessibility in the first place.</p>
						<p>Are you currently interested in accessibility?</p>
						<p>Are you telling the engineers about accessibility? </p>
						<p>Do you ensure that at least â…• of research participants has a disability? (true reflection/representation of your audience)</p>
						<p>Do you annotate design with accessible copy and interactions?</p>
						<p>Do you create user stories with accessibility in mind?</p>
						<p>Is accessible interface a definition of done?</p>
						<p>What do you use to test accessible interfaces?</p>

					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>It's important to remember that accessibility isn't a standalone thing that you can test in isolation.</p>
						<p>It's a mindset of creating a usable experience for everyone.</p>
						<p>It still needs humans to work together to create something truly inclusive.</p>
						<p>What are you, designers and researchers, doing, to get engineers involved in your processes?</p>
						<p>Inclusive and accessible design only happens when we truly understand our users, and that the culture and processes reinforces the focus on that understanding.</p>
						<p>When engineers are involved in the design process, it's easier for them to consider accessibility. It's just a part of writing good code and making useful software.</p>
						<p>You thought you came to a talk about getting people interested accessibility. But in the truth is, they need to first be interested in design, and fall in love with the customer problems as hard as you do.</p>
						<p>It is UX' job to advocate for users in both your designs, and to your colleagues.</p>
