						<p>Hi, I'm Prae, a Thai woman with shoulder length dark hair. I'm wearing a large pair of dark full-frame glasses and a mint coloured shirt.</p>
						<p>I've been a UX focused front-end web engineer for 9 years.</p>
						<p>But I actually started my career as a designer. Hence my deep appreciation for design craft, especially UX parts of it.</p>
						<p>I love coding up designs in a responsive manner, and improving usability of those designs through code.</p>
						<p>I spent most of my career focusing on how to make UI design and UX pattern scales.</p>
						<p>I've done that while collaborating closely with designers, to ensure that there is reasonable consistency between implementation and designer's vision. I rely heavily on in-house pattern libraries and design systems to do that.</p>
						<p>I owe a lot of my career to the UX designers and researchers I've worked with. That's apparently most of you. </p>
						<p>You have constantly reminded me of who my users are, and their needs. You've helped me understand our user's feedback after features have been released, and collaborate on a way to incorporate that feedback.</p>
						<p>In the last few years, I've gone even deeper into my front-end craft, and have been focusing my efforts on creating and advocating for accessible interfaces. </p>
						<p>As I advocate, I noticed a different level of enthusiasm for accessibility among all roles. Some are really enthusiastic about it, and some, not so much.</p>
						<p>Over and over, I come accross a theme of sentiments...</p>

					<blockquote>
						Engineers are less engaged with accessibility
					</blockquote>
					<p>If true... Why is that?</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Many designers told me that it's hard to get engineers engaged in accessibility.</p>
						<p>Engineers just don't seem interested!</p>
						<p>Some designers even struggle with getting their designs implemented properly in the first place. Let alone getting it implemented in a technically accessible way. </p>
						<p>Everyone's situation is different. Assuming that this statement is actually true... The main question, is why?</p>
						<p>Why aren't engineers more engaged in accessibility work?</p>
						<p>To answer that question, let's take a step back, and treat engineers likeâ€¦ A user.</p>
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h2>Engineers as a user</h2>
					<p class="fragment">
						non-traditional &amp; traditional background
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>From my humble understanding of the user centred design practice, you start by empathising with your users. In this case, you'd ask:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Who are the engineers?</li>
							<li>What do they need to do their job?</li>
							<li>What do they want?</li>
							<li>How they currently do things</li>
							<li>How they'd like to do them</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<p>[Next] First, who are the engineers?</p>
						<p>At a high level, my job is to implement the best possible technological solution to a problem.</p>
						<p>Like any user group, engineers come from diverse backgrounds. They could be neurodiverse, disabled, don't have a university degree, and etc.</p>
						<p>But the aspect that I want to highlight, is that not all engineers had formal education related to programming.</p>
						<p>They may haved started their career through a self-taught portfolio or junior talent programme.</p>
						<p>For engineers from non-traditional like myself, my skillset was mostly developed by tasks that my workplace prioritise, and teaches me.</p>
						<p>I happen to work in a place with a lot of UI focused work, and interactions with designers. So I am stronger with that aspect of programming.</p>
						<p>For traditional types of programmers, they took a degree that taught them nothing about design, and everything to do with how to break down problems and solve it using technologies.</p>
						<p>Unless the engineer was taught or worked closely with design and research, they wouldn't understand how to proactively approach these subjects.</p>

					<h3>Responsible for...</h3>
					<p>
						Creating, testing, &amp; maintaining software<span class="fragment"><br>in a <em>usable, secure, privacy focused, responsive, scalable, testable, maintainable, performant, efficient, resilient, safe, accessible,</em> and 100+ manner</span>
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>In most companies, engineers are expected to create, test and maintain software.</p>
						<p>That's pretty reasonable right?</p>
						<p>The trickier thing, is the manner in which they're expected to engineer software</p>
						<hr>
						<p>[Next]</p>
						<p>We have to engineer software, in a usable, secure, privacy focused, responsive, scalable, testable, maintainable, performant, efficient, resilient, safe, accessible, and 100+ manner</p>
						<p>Not a very readable slide is it? It just goes to show what is on engineer's mind when they're writing that 10 lines of code.</p>
						<p>This is why, writing code is a team sport. And why there'll always be more engineers than designers.</p>
						<p>It's not possible for 1 engineer to be able to write code in all the ways we expect our software to be. It takes different types of engineers with different specialities to make up a team of people, who can collectively do all of this.</p>
						<p>Multiple people will help remind eachother to be accountable for different aspect of software engineering practice.</p>

						<p>In order for us to engineer web application in such ways, many of us will have to learn and use a lot of these tools and concepts</p>
						<p>They may be a front-end focus engineer like myself, a backend person, or a full-stack which covers both side of these learning paths.</p>
						<p>Where does accessibility fits into all this? Well... here [next]</p>
						<p>But as you can see, it's a rather small part of the front-end engineering toolkit and practice. If your developer is backend focused, or is a full-stack, it's even less likely that they'd already how to implement accessible experiences.</p>

					<h3>Want...</h3>
					<p>Priority, process, simplicity</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Since engineers are responsible for so many things and have to constantly learn to keep up with the technologies, I want 3 things in this particular order: Priority, process, simplicity</p>
						<p>
							First, I want to <strong>prioritise</strong> things that are more important or pressing.
						</p>
						<p>
							If I don't understand, or am not aware of the context or user problems of a particular solution, I will rely heavily upon what designers and product managers tell me are important things to work on and why.
						</p>
						<p>
							If assistive technology user isn't a part of the things product functions prioritise, I'm less likely to prioritise its support.
						</p>
						<hr>
						<p>
							Second, I want <strong>processes</strong> to help them manage my load
						</p>
						<p>
							This comes in the form of all sorts of methodologies. Often scrum and its family of ceremonies like standups, backlog refinement etc.
						</p>
						<hr>
						<p>
							Lastly, I want to <strong>simplify</strong> as much as possible
						</p>
						<p>
							Not because I do not want to do the work. Far from it. But breaking down into simplest and smallest units help me ship things out faster, and reduce the amount of in-progress things I need to think about.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unfortunately, this also means that things which are not explicitly mentioned in the requirements or definition of done, can be easily missed.

						<p>At the very least, they need to know what they're building. A feature? A whole new app? An app that lives inside an app? Or a design system component?</p>
						<p>Engineering </p>
						<p>Many engineers are curious. The good ones, not only want to know what they're building, but why they're building it.</p>

						<p>It's important to remember that accessibility isn't a standalone thing that you can test in isolation.</p>
						<p>It's a mindset of creating a usable experience for everyone.</p>
						<p>It still needs humans to work together to create something truly inclusive.</p>
