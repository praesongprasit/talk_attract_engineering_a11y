# Entice 'em, getting engineers excited about accessibility

This 20mins talk was prepared for:
- Allianz' UX CoPs annual event - 1st December 2022

“Let’s make our digital product accessible!!”

At best, you’ll get a lukewarm response to this statement from your engineering peers. As a web engineer myself, I can understand why.

It’s not that engineers don’t care about users with assistive needs. Often, it’s because we have competing concerns, and are not sure where to start.

In this talk, I will share ways we can empower engineers to be more energised about accessibility. Let's make it just a little bit more than a requirement!
